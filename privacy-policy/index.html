        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to Bedrock Cosmos. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. 
          This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our launcher 
          and services.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Bedrock Cosmos does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information or usage data from users.</strong> 
          The launcher operates entirely as a client-side proxy on your local device and does not send any information to our servers.
        </p>
        <p>Specifically, we do NOT collect:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Personal information (name, email, address, etc.)</li>
          <li>Usage data or analytics</li>
          <li>Technical information about your device</li>
          <li>Your Minecraft account information</li>
          <li>Any gameplay or interaction data</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Custom Cape Submissions:</strong> If you voluntarily choose to submit custom cape designs through 
          our Discord server for inclusion in Bedrock Cosmos, we will collect and store those cape files along with 
          your Discord username to identify the creator. This is entirely optional and only occurs when you actively 
          submit content to our community. These submitted capes may be made available to all Bedrock Cosmos users 
          through the launcher.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you join our Discord server for support or community interaction, Discord's own privacy policy applies 
          to that interaction. We may see your Discord username and any content you voluntarily share in the server, 
          but this is separate from the Bedrock Cosmos launcher itself.
        </p>

        <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>
          Since Bedrock Cosmos does not collect any user information from the launcher itself, there is no personal 
          data for us to use, share, or process. The launcher functions entirely locally on your device as a proxy 
          between your Minecraft client and Minecraft servers.
        </p>
        <p>All processing occurs on your device, including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Adding custom capes to your game experience</li>
          <li>Revealing hidden marketplace content for your region</li>
          <li>Restoring missing features to skin packs (capes, animations, skins)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Submitted Custom Capes:</strong> If you submit custom cape designs through our Discord server, 
          we use those cape files to make them available to all Bedrock Cosmos users through the launcher's cape 
          library. Your submitted capes become part of the shared community collection.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p>
          Bedrock Cosmos does not collect or store any user data through the launcher. The launcher operates as 
          a local proxy on your device, intercepting and modifying network traffic between your Minecraft client 
          and Minecraft servers to provide custom capes, reveal hidden marketplace content, and restore skin pack 
          functionality.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Community-Submitted Capes:</strong> Custom cape designs that you voluntarily submit through our 
          Discord server are stored in our database along with your Discord username for creator attribution. This 
          allows us and other users to identify who created each cape design. The cape files themselves do not contain 
          any additional personal information beyond your Discord username.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>Bedrock Cosmos may interact with third-party services:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Discord:</strong> For community support and user engagement</li>
          <li><strong>GitHub:</strong> For open-source code hosting and distribution</li>
          <li><strong>Minecraft Services:</strong> The launcher acts as a proxy to Minecraft Bedrock servers</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These third-party services have their own privacy policies. We encourage you to review their policies 
          as we are not responsible for their privacy practices.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Cookies and Tracking</h2>
        <p>
          Bedrock Cosmos does not use cookies, tracking technologies, or analytics tools. The launcher does not 
          track your activity, collect usage statistics, or monitor your behavior in any way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our website (bedrock-cosmos.app) uses minimal functionality and does not employ tracking cookies or 
          analytics beyond basic web server logs that are standard for any website.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>
          Bedrock Cosmos is not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal 
          information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided 
          us with personal information, please contact us.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>
          Since Bedrock Cosmos does not collect any personal data through the launcher, there is no user data 
          for you to access or modify. The launcher operates entirely locally on your device.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Submitted Capes:</strong> If you have submitted custom capes to our community collection, you 
          have the right to request deletion at any time. Simply contact us through our Discord server with your 
          deletion request, and we will remove your submitted cape(s) from our database and the shared cape library.
        </p>

        <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
          We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify users of any material changes by 
          posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date. Your continued use 
          of Bedrock Cosmos after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
        </p>

        <h2>10. Open Source Transparency</h2>
        <p>
          Bedrock Cosmos is fully open source and available on GitHub. You can review our entire codebase to 
          verify that no data collection occurs. We believe in complete transparency, and we encourage technical 
          users to examine the code themselves to confirm our privacy claims.
        </p>
        <p>
          The open-source nature of the project ensures that any data collection would be immediately visible 
          to the community, providing an additional layer of accountability and trust.
        </p>

        <h2>11. Contact Us</h2>
        <p>
          If you have questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or our data practices, please contact us 
          through our Discord server.
        </p>
