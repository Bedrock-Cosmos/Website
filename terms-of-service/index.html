        </ul>
        <p>
          The service is provided free of charge, is fully open source, and operates entirely as a local proxy 
          without collecting any user data.
        </p>

        <h2>3. User Responsibilities</h2>

        <p>
          When using Bedrock Cosmos in multiplayer environments, you acknowledge that server administrators may 
          have their own rules regarding custom content. We are not responsible for any restrictions or bans 
          imposed by third-party servers.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>
          Bedrock Cosmos is open source software licensed under the terms specified in our GitHub repository. 
          While you are free to view and modify the code according to the license terms, you must provide 
          appropriate attribution when sharing or distributing the software.
        </p>
        <p>
          Custom capes and other content created by the community remain the property of their respective creators. 
          Minecraft, Minecraft Bedrock Edition, and related trademarks are the property of Mojang Studios and Microsoft.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
        <p>
          Bedrock Cosmos is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind, either express or implied. We do not 
          guarantee that the launcher will be error-free, secure, or continuously available. Use of the launcher 
          is at your own risk.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>
          To the maximum extent permitted by law, Bedrock Cosmos and its developers shall not be liable for any 
          indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, 
          whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses 
          resulting from:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Your use or inability to use the launcher</li>
          <li>Any unauthorized access to or use of our servers</li>
          <li>Any bugs, viruses, or harmful code transmitted through the launcher</li>
          <li>Any errors or omissions in the launcher's functionality</li>
          <li>Any actions taken by Mojang Studios, Microsoft, or server administrators in response to your use of the launcher</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>8. Third-Party Services and Content</h2>
        <p>
          Bedrock Cosmos interacts with Minecraft servers operated by Mojang Studios and Microsoft. We are not 
          affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Mojang Studios or Microsoft. Any issues with Minecraft 
          services should be directed to their official support channels.
        </p>

        <h2>9. Modifications to Service</h2>
        <p>
          We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue Bedrock Cosmos at any time without notice. 
          We may also update these Terms of Service periodically. Your continued use of the launcher after 
          changes constitutes acceptance of the modified terms.
        </p>

        <h2>10. User-Generated Content</h2>
        <p>
          When you submit custom cape designs through our Discord server for inclusion in Bedrock Cosmos, we will 
          store your cape file along with your Discord username for creator attribution. This allows us and other 
          users to identify who created each cape design in the shared community library.
        </p>
        <p>
          By submitting custom capes, you grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, display, 
          and distribute that content within the launcher and to other Bedrock Cosmos users. Your submitted capes 
          become part of the shared community collection and will be attributed to your Discord username.
        </p>
        <p>
          You represent that you have the right to grant this license and that your cape designs do not infringe 
          on any third-party rights, including copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property rights.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may request deletion of your submitted capes at any time by contacting us through our Discord server. 
          Upon receiving your request, we will remove your cape(s) from our database and the shared cape library.
        </p>

        <h2>11. Prohibited Uses</h2>
        <p>You agree not to use Bedrock Cosmos to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Violate any local, state, national, or international law</li>
          <li>Infringe upon or violate our intellectual property rights or the intellectual property rights of others</li>
          <li>Upload or transmit viruses or any other type of malicious code</li>
          <li>Attempt to gain unauthorized access to any systems or networks</li>
          <li>Engage in any conduct that restricts or inhibits anyone's use of the launcher</li>
          <li>Impersonate or attempt to impersonate Bedrock Cosmos, our developers, or any other user</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>12. Age Restrictions</h2>
        <p>
          Bedrock Cosmos is intended for users who meet the minimum age requirements for Minecraft Bedrock Edition 
          in their jurisdiction. If you are under 13 years of age (or the applicable age in your jurisdiction), 
          you must have parental consent to use our services.
        </p>

        <h2>13. Privacy</h2>
        <p>
          Your use of Bedrock Cosmos is also governed by our Privacy Policy. Please review our Privacy Policy to 
          understand our data collection and usage practices.
        </p>

        <h2>14. Termination</h2>
        <p>
          We reserve the right to terminate or suspend your access to Bedrock Cosmos immediately, without prior 
          notice or liability, for any reason, including breach of these Terms of Service.
        </p>

        <h2>15. Governing Law</h2>
        <p>
          These Terms of Service shall be governed by and construed in accordance with applicable laws, without 
          regard to conflict of law provisions.
        </p>

        <h2>16. Dispute Resolution</h2>
        <p>
          Any disputes arising from these terms or your use of Bedrock Cosmos should first be addressed through 
          our Discord community. If informal resolution is not possible, disputes shall be resolved through 
          binding arbitration or small claims court.
        </p>

        <h2>17. Severability</h2>
        <p>
          If any provision of these Terms of Service is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision 
          shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that these terms shall otherwise 
          remain in full force and effect.
        </p>

        <h2>18. Contact Information</h2>
        <p>

          repository.
